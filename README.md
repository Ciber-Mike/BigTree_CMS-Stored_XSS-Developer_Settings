# BigTree_CMS-Stored_XSS-Developer_Settings
**Software Link**: BigTree CMS [https://www.bigtreecms.org/download/core/]
**Author**: Miguel √Ångel Ruiz
**Description**: BigTree CMS version 4.5.7 is affected by a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the developer settings panel, enabling them to execute stored code when accessing the /site/index.php/admin/developer/settings resource.

---
# Proof of Concept

1. A setting is edited within the developer menu, injecting a payload (JavaScript code) into the `ID` field."

2. When the user accesses the `/site/index.php/admin/developer/settings` resource, this stored code is executed.
